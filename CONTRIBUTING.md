## Contributing

We appreciate all contributions! If you would like to contribute, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository: Using the GitHub website, you can click on the Fork button to create a copy of the repository in
   your GitHub account.

2. Clone the fork to your local machine: Using Git, you can clone your forked repository to your local machine to work
   on it locally.

3. Create a new branch: Before making changes, create a new branch in your local repository. This helps isolate your
   changes and makes it easier to merge your changes into the main repository later.

4. Make your changes: Make the changes you want to propose to the project. This could involve fixing bugs, adding new
   features, or improving documentation.

5. Commit your changes: Once you've made your changes, use Git to commit them to your local repository. Be sure to write
   a clear and useful commit message describing your changes.

6. Push your changes: Push your changes from your local repository to your forked repository on GitHub.

7. Open a pull request: From your forked repository on GitHub, open a new pull request to propose your changes to the
   main repository.

8. Discuss and review your changes: Once you have opened a pull request, maintainers of the main repository will review
   your changes. They may suggest changes or improvements. This is also an opportunity for other contributors to comment
   on your changes.

Remember, contributions aren't just about code â€“ improving documentation, submitting bug reports, and participating in
discussions are all valued!

Thank you for your contributions!
